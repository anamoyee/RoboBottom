## This is the main branch which contains **UNIFNISHED** v2 version. To get the fully functional (although kinda janky and it-really-required-this-rewrite version go to [the archive branch](https://github.com/anamoyee/RoboBottom/tree/archive).

# RoboBottom
A clone/remake of **[RoboTop](https://robotop.xyz)**'s reminder system. RoboTop was originally made by **[Colon](https://gdcolon.com)** <img style="width: 15px; height: 15px;" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1132968267963715634.webp?size=64&name=fluff&quality=lossless"></img>. I remade the *reminders* part of that bot because of its shutdown on August 12th 2023. RIP RoboTop, You will be missed!

## How do I host it myself?
1. Install **[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and add it to PATH during instalation.
  - On Linux you can use **[Parafoxia](https://github.com/parafoxia)**'s **[Python Install Scripts](https://github.com/parafoxia/python-scripts)**
  - On Windows use the installer from **[Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** (or the Microsoft Store bleh)
2. Install python modules using the following command in the main project's directory. (`pip3.11`/`pip3` on linux)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. Create an application on **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)** and grant it all priviliged gateway intents.
2. The bot will try to find a file called `TOKEN.txt` up to two directories away (in cwd, parent & parent of parent). Create it and populate it with the bot's token.
3. Run the bot with the following command (`python3`/`python3.11` on linux)
```
python src/robobottom.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may use Python 3.12 if it works for you however i cannot guarantee it. Please use Python 3.11 if possible.

At the tone, the exact time will be 0800 hours.
